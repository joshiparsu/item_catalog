      "description" : "In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, The Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed",

To find out, a manned spacecraft, the Discovery, is sent to investigate. Its crew is highly trained--the best--and they are assisted by a self-aware computer, the ultra-capable HAL 9000. But HAL's programming has been patterned after the human mind a little too well. He is capable of guilt, neurosis, even murder, and he controls every single one of Discovery's components. The crew must overthrow this digital psychotic if they hope to make their rendezvous with the entities that are responsible not just for the monolith, but maybe even for human civilization.",

First, her fearsome uncle, Lord Asriel, appears with evidence of mystery and danger in the far North, including photographs of a mysterious celestial phenomenon called Dust and the dim outline of a city suspended in the Aurora Borealis that he suspects is part of an alternate universe. He leaves Lyra in the care of Mrs. Coulter, an enigmatic scholar and explorer who offers to give Lyra the attention her uncle has long refused her. In this multilayered narrative, however, nothing is as it seems.

In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders.

      "description" : "In the village of King's Abbot, a widow's sudden suicide sparks rumors that she murdered her first husband, was being blackmailed, and was carrying on a secret affair with the wealthy Roger Ackroyd. The following evening, Ackroyd is murdered in his locked study--but not before receiving a letter identifying the widow's blackmailer. King's Abbot is crawling with suspects, including a nervous butler, Ackroyd's wayward stepson, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, who has taken up residence in the victim's home. It's now up to the famous detective Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King's Abbot to garden, to solve the case of who killed Roger Ackroyd--a task in which he is aided by the village doctor and narrator, James Sheppard, and by Sheppard's ingenious sister, Caroline.",

Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them.

Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this.

He keeps talking about how you can't predict the actions of one person anymore than you can predict the actions of one gas molecule and yet he keeps doing it. It's incredibly annoying.

What this format does is it encourages you to think about the questions it asks before reading about their answers. Sometimes, the questions are impossible to answer with the knowledge you have, but usually you can kind of tell when those are coming (the beginnings of chapters) and not spend too much time thinking about them. It starts out extremely basic, with simple recursive functions like getting the length of a linked list, and the first few chapters will all be things you know off the top of your head from an introductory CS course in college. However, as the book progresses, you see some really neat things like collecting values using lambdas inside recursions, the Y combinator, and even an implementation of a Scheme interpreter in Scheme!",

Well, Brandon Sanderson plays on that thought like no other. And that, is why this book is very good. I do warn, it is a little dark and depressingly evil in some cases, but it is a so good. Elantris had an underlying theme about Truth, and Mistborn has an underlying theme about Hope.",

Some think the first books are better, and that the series just gets old. I don't! Part of what I love about the series is that you get to know the characters. You get to feel for them, and love them. You also get to admire the intricacy with which Jordan interweaves his world.",

I found it really hard to actually connect with the characters and enjoy the writing and story properly because i watched the film before i read the book and all i could think of was how dramatised the film was or how 'that wasn't in the film'. Like I said overall I enjoyed it but just felt like I couldn't really enjoy as much as I'd have liked to because I'd watched the very dramatised holly wood film before reading it!",

Most of the characters in the great \"wonderland\" were either cruel, mean or contrary (or didn't make any sense). I would not have a child read this either. It's probably written for ages 5-7, but the dialogue doesn't make much sense, and with the constant threats of \"beheading\" and other such scenes, I recommend that no child read it! ",

At times I found myself believing that the Corleone's were right to be who they were, or at the very least, that such a way of life in de-centralized Sicily, if not in 20th century America, was appropriate.
